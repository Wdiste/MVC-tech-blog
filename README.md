  ## Installation
  
  Use the app directly on the web at <a href="https://tech-blog-wdiste.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a> or download the repo and open with vscode.  Once in vscode, run the 'npm i' command.  Once packages are installed, log into mysql using the command 'mysql -u `<your username>` -p'  then enter your password.  Navigate to the schema file and execute the commands there in the command line.  Once the db is created, use 'npm run seed' command to fill the db with data.  The application is now ready for use.

  To use this app, simply navigate to the <a href="https://tech-blog-wdiste.herokuapp.com/">website</a> or install and use the 'npm start' command in vscode terminal.  Go to localhost:3001 in your favorite browser to start.  The ui is intuitive, so viewing, creating, and updating posts is as simple as creating an account, logging in, and following the ui.
